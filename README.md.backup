## Features

*   Multi-keypress detection: The app instantly detects and displays each key press on the screen, allowing users to see if all the keys are functioning properly.
*   Key highlighting: When a key is pressed, it is visually highlighted on the virtual keyboard displayed on the screen, making it easy to identify the pressed keys.
*   Keycode log: Along with the key press, the app also shows the corresponding keycodes, which can be helpful for debugging.

## Build Instructions

To build and run the app on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code of the Keyboard Tester App.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the command `npm install`.

### Development Build

To build and run the app in development mode, use the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will start the development server. Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) on your browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger a rebuild, and the browser will refresh to reflect the changes.

### Production Build

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized production build of the app in the dist or build directory. The compiled files can then be deployed to a web server or used locally in a web browser.
